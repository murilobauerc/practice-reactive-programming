# practice-reactive-programming
Using YouTube videos, online courses and free content in the internet, I'm learning around reactive-programming with Java 8+.

## What is reactive programming in a few words?
Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that deals with asynchronous data streams (sequences of events) and the specific propagation of change, which means it implements modifications to the execution environment (context) in a certain order.
